# Password_generator

Simple password generator where you have the posibility to choose from a set of lists different characters such as symbols, numbers and letters (capital letters too)
to strengthen your password.
I don't consider this piece of code being such a big project but I found it out very usefull when I wanted to create a strong password and I wanted to recorded in my GitHub profile.
